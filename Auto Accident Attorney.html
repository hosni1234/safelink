<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #990000; font-size: large;">Before choosing an attorney, it is advisable to find potential candidates.

You may also consider checking online for an attorney. By reading through the customer reviews, you will be able to find the right attorney. Schedule an initial consultation with the attorneys that you are considering. During the initial consultations, a meeting with the attorney will seek to discuss the case. Make sure to ask questions about his/her experience, the case strategy, case management style and the rates chargeable.</span></div>

<span style="color: #f1c232; font-size: large;"><b>2. Determine the lawyer's experience</b></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="background-color: white; color: #0c343d; font-size: large;">An attorney with the necessary experience will be in a position to provide you with the necessary guidance. The attorney will be able to disclose the potential outcome of the case to define whether you should go to trial or negotiate a settlement. You may need to find a lawyer who specializes in helping people who may have sustained injuries during an accident. The attorney should possess the necessary knowledge in personal injury law and the way the laws apply to the auto accident. The lawyer you chose should be one who has worked on cases that are similar to yours. You may consider checking the credentials of the attorney by checking the lawyer's bio available on the web. Determine how long they have handled auto accident cases.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #0b5394; font-size: large;"><b>3. Assess the attorney's case strategy</b></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: red; font-size: large;">Next, you may need to review the attorney's proposed strategy in handling you case. It is equally important to assess the lawyer's legal options. Consider how he/she seeks to handle your lawsuit. If he/she has assessed the outcomes to your satisfaction and you agree with the proposed strategy, you may consider hiring the services of the attorney.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #45818e; font-size: large;"><b>4. Legal fees</b></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color: #45818e; font-size: large;">Most auto accident attorneys work on contingency. This means they are paid when you win the case and are awarded your compensation. The benefit of this kind of fee structure is the fact that the attorney is not paid up front or when the case is unsuccessful. The attorney may also charge his/her services based on an hourly rate. Therefore, the payment is based on the actual time worked on the lawsuit, regardless of the outcomes.</span></div>
